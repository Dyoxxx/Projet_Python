Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and Relative Entropy,Shui Feng,2022/10/24,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13142v1,"The Hierarchical Dirichlet process is a discrete random measure serving as animportant prior in Bayesian non-parametrics. It is motivated with the study ofgroups of clustered data. Each group is modelled through a level two Dirichletprocess and all groups share the same base distribution which itself is a drawnfrom a level one Dirichlet process. It has two concentration parameters withone at each level. The main results of the paper are the law of large numbersand large deviations for the hierarchical Dirichlet process and its mass whenboth concentration parameters converge to infinity. The large deviation ratefunctions are identified explicitly. The rate function for the hierarchicalDirichlet process consists of two terms corresponding to the relative entropiesat each level. It is less than the rate function for the Dirichlet process,which reflects the fact that the number of clusters under the hierarchicalDirichlet process has a slower growth rate than under the Dirichlet process.",ArXiv

We show thatthe Dirichlet spectral gap of these networks is substantially larger than thestandard spectral gap and is likely to remain non-zero in the infinite graphlimit. We first prove this result for finite regular trees, and show that theDirichlet spectral gap in the infinite tree limit converges to the spectral gapof the infinite tree. We also perform Dirichlet spectral clustering on theIP-layer networks and show that it often yields cuts near the network core thatcreate genuine single-component clusters. This is much better than traditionalspectral clustering where several disjoint fragments near the periphery areliable to be misleadingly classified as a single cluster. Spectral clusteringis often used to identify bottlenecks or congestion; since congestion in thesenetworks is known to peak at the core, our results suggest that Dirichletspectral clustering may be better at finding bona-fide bottlenecks.",ArXiv

Dirichlet-tree multinomial mixtures for clustering microbiome  compositions,"Jialiang Mao, Li Ma",2020/08/02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00400v2,"Studying the human microbiome has gained substantial interest in recentyears, and a common task in the analysis of these data is to cluster microbiomecompositions into subtypes. This subdivision of samples into subgroups servesas an intermediary step in achieving personalized diagnosis and treatment. Inapplying existing clustering methods to modern microbiome studies including theAmerican Gut Project (AGP) data, we found that this seemingly standard task,however, is very challenging in the microbiome composition context due toseveral key features of such data. Standard distance-based clusteringalgorithms generally do not produce reliable results as they do not take intoaccount the heterogeneity of the cross-sample variability among the bacterialtaxa, while existing model-based approaches do not allow sufficient flexibilityfor the identification of complex within-cluster variation from cross-clustervariation. Direct applications of such methods generally lead to overlydispersed clusters in the AGP data and such phenomenon is common for othermicrobiome data. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dirichlet-treemultinomial mixtures (DTMM) as a Bayesian generative model for clusteringamplicon sequencing data in microbiome studies. DTMM models the microbiomepopulation with a mixture of Dirichlet-tree kernels that utilizes thephylogenetic tree to offer a more flexible covariance structure incharacterizing within-cluster variation, and it provides a means foridentifying a subset of signature taxa that distinguish the clusters. Weperform extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of DTMM andcompare it to state-of-the-art model-based and distance-based clusteringmethods in the microbiome context.

In light of this, we developa finite mixture methodology that permits eliciting prior information directlyon the number of clusters in an intuitive way.

We present a principledapproach to this clustering problem based upon a Bayesian hierarchical modelthat accounts for both within- and between-motif variability. We use aDirichlet process prior distribution that allows the number of clusters to varyand we also present a novel generalization that allows the core width of eachmotif to vary. This clustering model is implemented, using a Gibbs samplingstrategy, on several collections of transcription factor motif matrices. Ourclusters provide a means by which to organize transcription factors based onbinding motif similarities, which can be used to reduce motif redundancy withinlarge databases such as JASPAR and TRANSFAC. Finally, our clustering procedurehas been used in combination with discovery of evolutionarily-conserved motifsto predict co-regulated genes. An alternative to our Dirichlet process priordistribution is explored but shows no substantive difference in the clusteringresults for our datasets.

The number of cluster is then inferreda posteriori from the data.  The present paper makes the following contributions in the context of sparsefinite mixture modelling. First, it is illustrated that the concept of sparsefinite mixture is very generic and easily extended to cluster various types ofnon-Gaussian data, in particular discrete data and continuous multivariate dataarising from non-Gaussian clusters. Second, sparse finite mixtures are comparedto Dirichlet process mixtures with respect to their ability to identify thenumber of clusters.

By suitable matching ofthese priors, it is shown that the choice of this hyper prior is far moreinfluential on the cluster solution than whether a sparse finite mixture or aDirichlet process mixture is taken into consideration.",ArXiv

In thispaper, we propose a novel Tensor Dirichlet Process Multinomial Mixture model(Tensor-DPMM), which is designed to preserve the multi-mode and hierarchicalstructure of the multi-dimensional trip information via tensor, and clusterthem in a unified one-step manner.

Colouring and breaking sticks: random distributions and heterogeneous  clustering,Peter J. Green,2010/03/21,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3988v1,"We begin by reviewing some probabilistic results about the Dirichlet Processand its close relatives, focussing on their implications for statisticalmodelling and analysis. We then introduce a class of simple mixture models inwhich clusters are of different `colours', with statistical characteristicsthat are constant within colours, but different between colours. Thus clusteridentities are exchangeable only within colours. The basic form of our model isa variant on the familiar Dirichlet process, and we find that much of thestandard modelling and computational machinery associated with the Dirichletprocess may be readily adapted to our generalisation. The methodology isillustrated with an application to the partially-parametric clustering of geneexpression profiles.",ArXiv

Furthermore, the textual content of a document is notalways linked to its temporal dynamics. We develop a flexible method to createclusters of textual documents according to both their content and publicationtime, the Powered Dirichlet-Hawkes process (PDHP).

We propose an efficient,nonparametric framework for simultaneous variable selection, clustering andprediction in high-throughput regression settings with continuous or discreteoutcomes, called VariScan. The VariScan model utilizes the sparsity induced byPoisson-Dirichlet processes (PDPs) to group the covariates intolower-dimensional latent clusters consisting of covariates with similarpatterns among the samples. The data are permitted to direct the choice of asuitable cluster allocation scheme, choosing between PDPs and their specialcase, a Dirichlet process. Subsequently, the latent clusters are used to builda nonlinear prediction model for the responses using an adaptive mixture oflinear and nonlinear elements, thus achieving a balance between model parsimonyand flexibility. We investigate theoretical properties of the VariScanprocedure that differentiate the allocations patterns of PDPs and Dirichletprocesses both in terms of the number and relative sizes of their clusters.Additional theoretical results guarantee the high accuracy of the model-basedclustering procedure, and establish model selection and prediction consistency.Through simulation studies and analyses of benchmark data sets, we demonstratethe reliability of VariScan's clustering mechanism and show that the techniquecompares favorably to, and often outperforms, existing methodologies in termsof the prediction accuracies of the subject-specific responses.",ArXiv
