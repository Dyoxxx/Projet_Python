What Risk Factors to Cause Long COVID and Its Impact on Patient Survival  Outcomes when Combined with the Effect from Organ Transplantation in the  Acute COVID,Jianghu Dong,2023/05/13,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07817v1,"Coronavirus disease 2019 in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients isassociated with more severe outcomes than non-immunosuppressed hosts. However,exactly which risk factors cause Long COVID in acute COVID cases remainsunknown. More importantly, the impact of Long COVID on patient survival remainsunderstudied, especially when examined alongside the effect of SOT. Allpatients have been identified with acute COVID in the National COVIDCollaborative Cohort registry. We compared patient demographics in Long COVIDvs. those without Long COVID based on descriptive statistics. Multivariablelogistics regressions were used to determine the factors related to thelikelihood of developing Long COVID from a case of acute COVID. Multi-variablesCox regression was used to determine the time-to-event outcome of patientsurvival with Long COVID. This study reviewed data from a cohort of 6,416,500acute COVID patients. Of that group, 31,744 patients developed Long COVID fromICD diagnosis. The mean (q1, q3) age was 39 (22, 57) years old, and 55% ofpatients were female. From this cohort, a total of 31,744 (1%) developed LongCOVID and 43,565 (1%) had SOT, with a total of 698 SOT patients identified withLong COVID. Mean age of those with Long COVID was 52 (39, 64) years old and 64%of patients were female. Most of the SOT patients were kidney transplantrecipients. From the Cox regression analysis of patient survival, there weremany significant factors related to patient survival, with elderly SOT patientshaving a much higher hazard ratio of 27.8 (26.3, 29.4). This study hasidentified the important risk factors that are more likely to cause Long COVIDin an acute COVID cohort. We investigated hazard ratios of patient survivalbased on multivariable Cox models, which found that Long COVID had a moredirect impact on survival in elderly patients and those with SOT.",ArXiv

Although thereexist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans,few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy.At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in thebiomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database ofCOVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted fromCOVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions inthe article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed adeep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classifythem accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (asof May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility ofCOVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show thatCOVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contributeto improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline todistinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types ofdiseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier fromnon-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4)From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptomsand clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate thedisease differences in the scientific publications.

Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mildCOVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% forother pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustnessof our method against different compositions of control groups.  Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from othertypes of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imagingfeatures derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results andclassification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosisof COVID-19.",ArXiv
COVID-19 Cough Classification using Machine Learning and Global  Smartphone Recordings,"Madhurananda Pahar, Marisa Klopper, Robin Warren, Thomas Niesler",2020/12/02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01926v2,"We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which candiscriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthycoughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact, easy toapply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limittransmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a coughsuggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects fromall six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating thatthe approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara datasetcontains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the secondsmaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19positive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoVlaboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are15\%-20\% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applyingthe synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-$p$-outcross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learningclassifiers: LR, KNN, SVM, MLP, CNN, LSTM and Resnet50. Our results show thatalthough all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the bestperformance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able todiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an areaunder the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able todiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, withan AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forwardselection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification iscost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable meansof non-contact COVID-19 screening.",ArXiv

In the first step, two residual networks wereindependently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patientsin a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Normfor Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wiseprobability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, theCT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm modelsto obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiarwith Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lowerprobabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps ofthe Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lungprobability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesionsegmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of theunsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients inthe external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results ofinfection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dicecoefficient and Jaccard index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitativeevaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach for Covid-19 infectious lesionsegmentation showed relatively satisfactory results. Since this framework doesnot require any annotated dataset, it could be used to generate very largetraining samples for the supervised machine learning algorithms dedicated tonoisy and/or weakly annotated datasets.",ArXiv

To betterunderstand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacypolicies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly usedCOVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extractand analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show thatSocial Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy andethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lotsof people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as theirprivacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps.

Aim: Inthis paper, we want to design a novel high-accuracy COVID-19 detection methodthat uses CXR images, which can consider the unique features of COVID-19 andthe similar features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia. Methods: Our methodconsists of two phases. One is self-supervised learning-based pertaining; theother is batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning. Self-supervisedlearning-based pretraining can learn distinguished representations from CXRimages without manually annotated labels. On the other hand, batch knowledgeensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category knowledge of images in abatch according to their visual feature similarities to improve detectionperformance. Unlike our previous implementation, we introduce batch knowledgeensembling into the fine-tuning phase, reducing the memory used inself-supervised learning and improving COVID-19 detection accuracy. Results: Ontwo public COVID-19 CXR datasets, namely, a large dataset and an unbalanceddataset, our method exhibited promising COVID-19 detection performance. Ourmethod maintains high detection accuracy even when annotated CXR trainingimages are reduced significantly (e.g., using only 10% of the originaldataset).

I take thelatter view and use covid indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data priorto estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020even though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty hasreceded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitudeand shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly orindirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virusoriginating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Early diagnosis is the primarychallenge of health care providers. In the earlier stage, medical organizationswere dazzled because there were no proper health aids or medicine to detect aCOVID-19. A new diagnostic tool RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase ChainReaction), was introduced. It collects swab specimens from the patient's noseor throat, where the COVID-19 virus gathers. This method has some limitationsrelated to accuracy and testing time. Medical experts suggest an alternativeapproach called CT (Computed Tomography) that can quickly diagnose the infectedlung areas and identify the COVID-19 in an earlier stage. Using chest CTimages, computer researchers developed several deep learning models identifyingthe COVID-19 disease. This study presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)and VGG16-based model for automated COVID-19 identification on chest CT images.The experimental results using a public dataset of 14320 CT images showed aclassification accuracy of 96.34% and 96.99% for CNN and VGG16, respectively.",ArXiv
A review of Deep learning Techniques for COVID-19 identification on  Chest CT images,"Briskline Kiruba S, Petchiammal A, D. Murugan",2022/07/29,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00032v2,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to humanity that directlyaffects the lungs. Automatic identification of COVID-19 is a challenge forhealth care officials. The standard gold method for diagnosing COVID-19 isReverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to collect swabs fromaffected people. Some limitations encountered while collecting swabs arerelated to accuracy and longtime duration. Chest CT (Computed Tomography) isanother test method that helps healthcare providers quickly identify theinfected lung areas. It was used as a supporting tool for identifying COVID-19in an earlier stage. With the help of deep learning, the CT imagingcharacteristics of COVID-19. Researchers have proven it to be highly effectivefor COVID-19 CT image classification. In this study, we review the recent deeplearning techniques that can use to detect the COVID-19 disease. Relevantstudies were collected by various databases such as Web of Science, GoogleScholar, and PubMed. Finally, we compare the results of different deep learningmodels, and CT image analysis is discussed.",ArXiv
COV19IR : COVID-19 Domain Literature Information Retrieval,"Arusarka Bose, Zili Zhou, Guandong Xu",2022/11/08,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04013v1,"Increasing number of COVID-19 research literatures cause new challenges ineffective literature screening and COVID-19 domain knowledge aware InformationRetrieval. To tackle the challenges, we demonstrate two tasks alongwithsolutions, COVID-19 literature retrieval, and question answering. COVID-19literature retrieval task screens matching COVID-19 literature documents fortextual user query, and COVID-19 question answering task predicts proper textfragments from text corpus as the answer of specific COVID-19 relatedquestions. Based on transformer neural network, we provided solutions toimplement the tasks on CORD-19 dataset, we display some examples to show theeffectiveness of our proposed solutions.",ArXiv
